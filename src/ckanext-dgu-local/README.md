# ckanext-dgu-local

This extension provides support for harvesting from Local Authority data portal that exposes datasets according to the LGA Inventory spec: https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-dgu-local/blob/master/ckanext/dgulocal/data/inventory.xsd . 

This currently has dependencies on UK specific data, but the extension should work if the inventory document doesn't reference the UK specific publisher and temporal URLs.


## Dependencies

The LGA Inventory harvester relies on this version of ckanext-harvest:

    https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-harvest/tree/1508-update

## Installation

For development you should install ckanext-dgu-local as follows.

1. Install this extension as normal using pip in your activated environment:

    (pyenv) $ pip install -e "git+https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-dgu-local.git#egg=ckanext-dgu-local"

2. Activate the plugins by adding them to the CKAN config and then restarting CKAN:

    ckan.plugins = ...other_plugins... dgu_local lga_harvester

3. Setup the database tables:

    paster --plugin=ckanext-dgu-local dgulocal init --config=ckan_default.ini


## Plugins

`dgu_local` will provide any UI/search enhancements

`lga_harvester` is used for harvesting from the LGA Inventory format.


## Running tests

The tests for ckanext-dgu-local can be run from the ckanext-dgu-local folder using:

    nosetests --ckan --with-pylons=test-core.ini ckanext/dgulocal/tests

And some tests do not use the database so can be run in sqlite:

    nosetests --ckan --with-pylons=test.ini ckanext/dgulocal/tests/test_harvester.py
