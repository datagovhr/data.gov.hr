Each hearing is a lay tribunal involving three members of the panel and must consist of at least one man and one woman. It should also where possible reflect a mix of ages and experience.
The hearing is usually held in a relatively informal setting and is chaired by one of the panel members.
The local authority provides information about how to become a children's panel member.
In Scotland the children's hearings system relies on the involvement of around 2,500 volunteers who give their time and commitment to training and serving as children's panel members.</Description><Created>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Created><Modified>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Modified><Type>Service</Type></Service><Service><Identifier>1282</Identifier><Label>Educational support for looked after children</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/service/1282</URI><Description>The Looked After Children Education Support Service is responsible for ensuring that the local authority promotes the educational achievement of the children and young people in its care.</Description><Created>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Created><Modified>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Modified><Type>Service</Type></Service><Service><Identifier>53</Identifier><Label>Family centres</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/service/53</URI><Description>Family centres, often in conjunction with other agencies such as health visitors, offer parents of young children help, advice, support and information on all aspects of parenting.</Description><Created>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Created><Modified>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Modified><Type>Service</Type></Service><Service><Identifier>1579</Identifier><Label>Family information services</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/service/1579</URI><Description>The Family Information Service (FIS) provides information and advice to parents and carers on a wide-range of issues affecting every day family life to families with children and young people aged between 0 and 20 years of age.</Description><Created>2011-05-31T00:00:00</Created><Modified>2011-05-31T00:00:00</Modified><Type>Service</Type></Service><Service><Identifier>831</Identifier><Label>Family support groups</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/service/831</URI><Description>Information and advice about organisations in the local area who may be able to provide support to children and their families.</Description><Created>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Created><Modified>2013-04-03T14:06:44.910</Modified><Type>Service</Type></Service><Service><Identifier>159</Identifier><Label>Fostering</Label><URI>http://id.esd.org.uk/service/159</URI><Description>Fostering provides homes for children who are temporarily unable to live with their own families but who wish to maintain contact.
