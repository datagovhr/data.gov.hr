Description: CKAN software provides a hub for datasets. The flagship site running CKAN 
        is theDataHub.org but it is also used for dozens of other open data websites
        run by governments, agencies and citizens.
        
        CKAN provides a place to search for open knowledge resources as well as 
        register your own - be that a set of Shakespeare's works, a global 
        population density database, the voting records of MPs, or 30 years of 
        US patents.
        
        CKAN is an abbreviation for 'Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network'. 
        Those familiar with Freshmeat or CPAN can think of CKAN as providing an
        analogous service for open data and knowledge.
