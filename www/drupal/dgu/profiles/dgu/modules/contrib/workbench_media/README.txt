1.  Introduction

Workbench Media provides integration with the File, File Entity, and Media
modules for Workbench and its suite of modules.

Workbench Media provides some basic file management within the Workbench
framework; essentially, it allows users to see all files that have been
uploaded to the site.

----
1.1  Use-case

Media module is a solution for managing various media files including
images, video, and audio.  The Media Workbench module allows a user to add
media items without having to leave the Workbench.

A typical request from clients is to re-use files that have already been
uploaded to a site.  Any type of file might be re-used: PDF, PNG, ZIP.

----
1.2  Examples

To support large numbers of photo galleries or slideshows it's nice to provide
a reverse lookup.  Create your photo gallery, then create media items and
use a node reference field to choose which gallery will display the media item.

Adding a media item on its own requires having access to Find Content -> Media
tab.  We wanted to simplify where content administrators need to go to add
any content.


----
2.  Installation

Workbench and Media (7.x-2.x) are required in order to install Workbench Media.


----
3.  Permissions

Permissions need to be set for Media and Workbench Media modules in order to
make use of Workbench Media.

Workbench Media has one permission:

 -- Use the media add form
 Allows the user to add media directly from the Create Content tab.

A typical permission setup so that a user can take advangate of Workbench Media
looks like:

  Media Permissions
   -- View media
   -- Edit media

  Workbench
   -- Access My Workbench

  Workbench Media
   -- Use the media add form

A user needs the "Access My Workbench" permission which is a general
Workbench permission setting.  If a user has Access My Workbench permission,
then she can access Workbench Files.


----
4.  Configuration

There is no specific configuration for Workbench Media.


----
5.  Using the module

When viewing the Workbench, you can access media items in two ways.

Click the Create Content tab.  The Create Media list is at the top.  Click
Upload Media.  From there you select a file to upload.  Click Save, and it is
saved as a media item.

Media items are entities.  You can easily expand a media item to contain any
important meta data you want to store with the uploaded file.  Learn more at
http://drupal.org/project/media

Back in My Workbench, you can see media you have uploaded in the File List tab.

When viewing My Workbench, you will see that Workbench Media adds a tab
called "File List".  Click this tab.

The File List tab provides a list of all files that have been uploaded to the
site.  Typical web image file formats (like jpg, png, gif) will include a
thumbnail of the image in the Type column.  Other file types like PDF display a
icon representing the file type.

The list includes which nodes use the file, the URL as well as the filepath
(e.g. public://filename.pdf).


----
6.  Troubleshooting

When I add media, I get a Permission Denied error when I click save.
  -- Fix this by setting the "View media" and "Edit media" permissions for your
  user role.

7.  Developer notes

The following section documents technical details of interest to developers.

----
7.1   API documentation

Workbench Media does not offer an API.

----
7.2   Database schema

Workbench Media does not create any tables during installation.

----
8.  Feature roadmap

We think some of the changes made for Workbench Media may roll back into Media.
Workbench Media has been merged with Workbench Files. Please see "tasks" in the
Workbench Media issue queue for information on the current direction:
